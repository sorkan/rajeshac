                                     PART I                                     



	Badger Meter, Inc. (the Company) is a leading innovator, manufacturer and marketer of products incorporating flow measurement and control technologies serving markets worldwide.  The Company was incorporated in 1905.

	Throughout this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words we, us and our refer to the Company.


	The Company's Internet address is </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#0000ff;text-decoration:underline;">http://www.badgermeter.com</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The Company makes available free of charge (other than an investor's own Internet access charges) through its Internet website its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, on the same day they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


	An innovator in flow measurement and control products, the Company serves water utilities, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers worldwide.  Measuring water, oil, chemicals and other fluids, the Companys products are known for accuracy, long-lasting durability and for providing valuable and timely measurement data.   The Companys product lines fall into three categories: sales of water meters and related technologies to municipal water utilities (municipal water), sales of meters to various industries for water and other fluids (industrial flow), and sales of gas meter radios and concrete vibrators to unique markets (specialty products).  The Company estimates that over 75% of its products are used in water applications when all categories are grouped together.

	Municipal water, the largest category by sales volume, includes mechanical and electronic (static) water meters and related technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues.  The key market for the Companys water meter products is North America, primarily the United States, because most meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.  Sales of water meters and related technologies and services are commonly referred to as residential or commercial water meter sales, the latter referring to larger sizes of meters.  

	Industrial flow includes products sold worldwide to measure and control materials flowing through a pipe or pipeline including water, air, steam, oil, and other liquids and gases.  These meters and valves are used in a variety of applications, such as water/wastewater; heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC); oil and gas; chemical and petrochemical; food and beverage; and pharmaceutical production. 

	Specialty products include sales of radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters, and concrete vibrators.

	Residential and commercial water meters are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology.  A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that gives a visual meter reading display.  Meters equipped with radio transmitters (endpoints) use encoder registers to convert the measurement data from the meter into an encrypted digital format which is then transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems.  Mobile systems, referred to as automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, have been the primary technology deployed by water utilities over the past two decades, providing accurate and cost-effective billing data.  In an AMR system, a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities meters.

	Fixed network advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems continue to build interest among water utilities.  These systems incorporate a network of permanent data collectors or gateway receivers that are always active or listening for the radio transmission from the utilities meters.  AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect meter reading data.  These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data from the utilities meters at specified intervals.  


	Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider the significant business risks described below in addition to the other information set forth or incorporated by reference in this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements at the front of this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The following list of risk factors may not be exhaustive.  We operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment, and new risk factors may emerge from time to time.  We can neither predict these new risk factors with certainty nor assess the precise impact, if any, on our business, or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may adversely impact our results of operations.  While there is much uncertainty, we do analyze the risks we face, perform a probability assessment of their impacts and attempt to soften their potential impact when and if possible.


	Competitive pressures in the marketplace for our products could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits.  We operate in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense and a number of our competitors have greater financial resources.  Our competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products, particularly those that provide radio solutions.  The principal elements of competition for our most significant product applications, residential and commercial water meters for the municipal water utility market (with various radio technology systems), are price, product technology, quality and service.  The competitive environment is also affected by the movement toward radio technologies and away from manually read meters, the demand for replacement units and, to some extent, such things as global economic conditions, the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus fund programs, the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of our products, our ability to obtain financing, housing starts in the United States, and overall economic activity.  For our industrial flow and specialty products, the competitive environment is affected by the general economic health of various industrial sectors particularly in the United States and Europe.

	We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards.  Although we believe that we currently have a competitive advantage in this area, maintaining such advantage will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities.  There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantage.  If we are unable to maintain our competitive advantage, our future financial performance may be adversely affected.   We are not currently aware </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">6


	
	We are affected by the availability and prices for raw materials, including purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components that are used in the manufacturing process.  The inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by decreasing profit margins and by negatively impacting timely deliveries to customers.  In the past, we have been able to offset increases in raw materials and component parts by increased sales prices, active materials management, product engineering programs and the diversity of materials used in the production processes.  However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to accomplish this in the future.  Since we do not control the actual production of these raw materials and component parts, there may be delays caused by an interruption in the production of these materials for reasons that are beyond our control.  World commodity markets and inflation may also affect raw material and component part prices.


	The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, or conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by a Securities and Exchange Commission reporting company.  The minerals that the final rules cover are commonly referred to as 3TG and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.  Implementation of the new disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the materials that we use in the manufacture of our products.  Our supply chain is complex, and if we are not able to determine the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or that our products are conflict free, then we may face reputational challenges with customers or investors.  We could also incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure and audit requirements.


	As a supplier of products, the majority of which are to water utilities, we may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, delays in governmental programs created to stimulate the economy, and the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations that affect our customers, including independent distributors, large city utilities, private water companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities.  These customers may delay capital projects, including non-critical maintenance and upgrades, or may not have the ability to authorize and finance purchases during economic downturns or instability in world markets.  We also sell products for other applications to reduce our dependency on the municipal water market.  A significant downturn in this market could cause a material adverse impact on sales and operating results.  Therefore, a downturn in general economic conditions, as well as in the municipal water market, and delays in the timing or amounts of possible economic stimulus fund programs, government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations, or the availability of funds to municipalities could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm the business.


	Our sales may be adversely affected by unusual weather and natural phenomena that could have an impact on the timing of orders in given periods, depending on the particular mix of customers being served by us at the time.


	If we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures, our products will not meet required performance standards.  Product quality and performance are a priority for us since our products are used in various applications where precise control of fluids is essential.  Although we believe we have a very good reputation for product quality, any future production and/or sale of substandard products would seriously harm our reputation, resulting in both a loss of current customers to competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers.  In addition, if any of our products prove to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products.  A successful claim brought against </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">7



	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  For example, we may be subject to workers' compensation claims, employment/labor disputes, customer and supplier disputes, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes and contractual disputes related to warranties arising out of the conduct of our business.  Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability or financial condition.

	We sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer.  A failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

	We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights.  These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information.  In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry, and software products may increasingly be subject to third-party infringement claims.  Such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. 


	We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future environmental or regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted.  Compliance with such laws or regulations may entail additional expenses that could decrease profitability.  We are subject to a variety of environmental laws, such as lead content in certain meters incorporating brass housings, and regulatory laws affecting the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products, as well as regulations related to customs and trade practices.  Currently, the cost of complying with existing laws is included as part of our on-going expenses and does not have a material effect on our business or financial position, but a change in the future could adversely affect our profitability.


	Since we sell products worldwide as well as manufacture products in several countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.  These risks include such things as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements, differing labor regulations, and the difficulty of managing widespread operations.


	Our success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, develop and retain skilled personnel throughout our organization.  Current and future compensation arrangements, including benefits, may not be sufficient to attract new employees or retain existing employees, which may hinder our growth.  


	We estimate liabilities and expenses for retirement plans and other postretirement benefits that require the use of assumptions relating to the rates used to discount the future estimated liability, rate of return on any assets and various assumptions related to the age and cost of the workforce.  Actual results may differ from the estimates and have a material </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">8



	We have a history of good corporate governance, including procedures and processes that are required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules and regulations, such as board committee charters, and a code of business conduct that defines how employees interact with our various stakeholders and addresses issues such as confidentiality, conflict of interest and fair dealing, and applicable exchange listing standards.  Failure to maintain these corporate governance practices could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.


	As part of our business strategy, we continue to evaluate and may pursue selected business or product acquisition opportunities that we believe may provide us with certain operating and financial benefits.  If we complete any such acquisitions, they may require integration into our existing business with respect to administrative, financial, sales, marketing, manufacturing and other functions to realize these anticipated benefits.  If we are unable to successfully integrate a business or product acquisition, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities may arise during or after completion of an acquisition.


	None.

	In the normal course of business, the Company is named in legal proceedings from time to time.  There are currently no material legal proceedings pending with respect to the Company.  The more significant legal proceedings are discussed below.

	Like other companies in recent years, the Company is named as a defendant in numerous pending multi-claimant/multi-defendant lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos, manufactured by third parties, and integrated into or sold with a very limited number of the Companys products.  The Company is vigorously defending itself against these claims.  Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company does not believe </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">9


	The Company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations.  Information about the Company's compliance with environmental regulations is included in Part I, Item 1 of this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Environmental Protection.

	Debt as a percent of total debt and equity equals total debt (the sum of short-term debt, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) divided by the sum of total debt and total shareholders' equity at year-end.  The debt of the discontinued French operations is included in this calculation through 2007, the years of ownership, although there was no debt at the end of 2007 related to the French operations.
	Price/earnings ratio equals the year-end closing stock price for common stock divided by diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.



	An innovator in flow measurement and control products, the Company serves water utilities, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers worldwide.  Measuring water, oil, chemicals and other fluids, the Companys products are known for accuracy, long-lasting durability and for providing valuable and timely measurement data.   The Companys product lines fall into three categories: sales of water meters and related technologies to municipal water utilities (municipal water), sales of meters to various industries for water and other fluids (industrial flow), and sales of gas meter radios and concrete vibrators to unique markets (specialty products).  The Company estimates that over 75% of its products are used in water applications when all categories are grouped together.

	Municipal water, the largest category by sales volume, includes mechanical and electronic (static) water meters and related technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues.  The key market for the Companys water meter products is North America, primarily the United States, because most meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.  Sales of water meters and related technologies and services are commonly referred to as residential or commercial water meter sales, the latter referring to larger sizes of meters.  

	Industrial flow includes products sold worldwide to measure and control materials flowing through a pipe or pipeline including water, air, steam, oil, and other liquids and gases.  These meters and valves are used in a variety of applications, such as water/wastewater; heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC); oil and gas; chemical and petrochemical; food and beverage; and pharmaceutical production. 

	Specialty products include sales of radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters, and concrete vibrators.

	Additional information about the Company's business is described in Part 1, Item 1 Business under the heading Market Overview, Products, Systems and Solutions in this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K.


	Increasingly, the electric utility industry relies on AMI technology for two-way communication to monitor and control electrical devices at the customer's site.  Although the Company does not sell products for electric market applications, the trend toward AMI affects the markets in which the Company does participate, particularly for those customers in the water utility market that are interested in more frequent and diverse data collection.  Specifically, AMI and AMA technologies enable water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals.  Similar to the electric utility industry a few years ago, the water utility industry is beginning to see the adoption of electronic (static) water meters.  Electronic water metering has lower barriers to entry which could affect the competitive landscape in North America.

	The Company sells its technology solutions to meet customer requirements.  Since the technology products have comparable margins, any change in the mix between AMR, AMI or AMA is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's net sales related to meter reading technology.

	Net sales in 2013 increased $14.4 million, or 4.5%, to $334.1 million from $319.7 million in 2012.  The overall increase was due primarily to higher sales of municipal water products as a result of higher volumes of units sold, offset somewhat by lower sales of industrial and specialty products.

	Municipal water sales increased $17.9 million, or 8.4%, to $231.1 million in 2013 from $213.2 million in 2012.  These sales represented 69.2% of total net sales in 2013 compared to 66.7% in 2012.  The sales increase was due to higher sales of residential meters sold both with and without technology as well as higher commercial meter sales.  Sales of residential meters and related technology increased 6.9% for the year due to higher volumes of product sold, slightly offset by lower average prices.  Commercial water meter sales increased 15.2% in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to higher volumes of product sold.  The Company believes the net overall increase for the year was a continuation of a return to normal buying patterns that began in 2012, although sales were negatively affected in early 2013 by a colder and snowier winter and the effects of Hurricane Sandy.  In addition, part of the increase was due to additional sales to former customers of a competitor that ceased North American production of mechanical meters on June 30, 2013.  The Company estimates sales to these customers were approximately $4.1 million in 2013.   

	Industrial flow products represented 27.3% of total net sales in 2013 compared to 29.0% in 2012.  These sales decreased $1.6 million, or 1.7%, to $91.2 million from $92.8 million in 2012.  Sales of products within this category were affected by general economic conditions which resulted in weaker orders.  

	Specialty products represented 3.5% of total net sales in 2013 compared to 4.3% in 2012.  These sales decreased $1.9 million in 2013, or 13.9%, to $11.8 million from $13.7 million in 2012.  The decline was caused by lower sales of radios into the natural gas market and lower sales of concrete vibrators.

	International sales for municipal water meters and related technologies are generally made to customers in Canada and Mexico, which use similar mechanical technology and standards as customers in the U.S.  International sales for industrial flow and specialty products are generally made throughout the world.  In Europe, sales are made primarily in Euros.  Other international sales are made in U.S. dollars or local currencies.  International sales decreased 9.3% to $44.1 million in 2013 from $48.6 million in 2012 primarily due to the timing of large projects and general economic conditions.  

	Net sales in 2012 increased $56.8 million, or 21.6%, to $319.7 million from $262.9 million in 2011.  The overall increase was due to the inclusion of Racine Federateds net sales for eleven months of the year and higher municipal water sales, offset somewhat by lower sales of radios to natural gas utilities.  Racine Federateds sales for the eleven months ended December 31, 2012 were $41.3 million. 

	Municipal water sales increased $22.9 million, or 12.0%, to $213.2 million in 2012 from $190.3 million in 2011.  These sales represented 66.7% of total net sales in 2012 compared to 72.4% in 2011.  The sales increase was due to higher sales of residential meters sold with technology as well as higher commercial meter sales.  Sales of meters with technology increased 11.6% for the year due to higher volumes of product sold.  Sales of manually read residential meters were essentially flat between years.  Commercial water meter sales increased 19.5% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher volumes of product sold.  The Company believes the net overall increase for the year was due to normal buying patterns beginning to resume after a period where there were negative factors affecting market conditions.  These factors included lingering concerns about municipal spending, which resulted in delayed buying decisions, and slower housing starts.  In addition, the Companys introduction in 2011 of the next generation of the ORION product lengthened the sales cycle for water utilities as they evaluated this new technology.  Weather may have also played a role as poor weather in the Midwest and Northeast had a negative impact on sales in early 2011 due to its effects on budget demands and installation rates, which did not recur in early 2012.

	Industrial flow products represented 29.0% of total net sales in 2012 compared to 21.5% in 2011.  These sales increased $36.2 million, or 64.0%, to $92.8 million from $56.6 million in 2011.  As previously noted, Racine Federated was acquired on January 31, 2012 and Racine Federateds sales were included from that point forward.  Within this product grouping, Racine Federateds sales were $32.6 million.  The remainder of the increase was due to higher sales in most of the remaining industrial flow product lines. 

	Specialty products represented 4.3% of total net sales in 2012 compared to 6.1% in 2011.  These sales decreased $2.3 </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">16


	International sales for municipal water meters and related technologies are generally made to customers in Canada and Mexico, which use similar mechanical technology and standards as customers in the U.S.  International sales for industrial flow and specialty products are generally made throughout the world.  In Europe, sales are made primarily in Euros.  Other international sales are made in U.S. dollars or local currencies.  International sales increased 53.8% to $48.6 million in 2012 from $31.6 million in 2011 primarily due to the addition of Racine Federateds product lines.  

	
	Gross margins as a percentage of sales were 35.0%, 38.2% and 34.2% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The percentage decline in 2013 from the 2012 rate was due to a higher mix of municipal water sales compared to industrial flow sales which carry higher margins, lower prices charged to the former customers of a competitor that ceased North American production of water meters, higher obsolete inventory charges, higher costs of electronics due to foreign exchange effects, and higher costs of metal alloy as the shift to lead-free brass was completed.  

	The gross margin percentage increase in 2012 over the 2011 rate was due in part to the addition of Racine Federateds products, whose margins are generally a higher percentage than the Companys overall weighted margin percentage.  Margins also increased due to lower costs for castings which fluctuate with the metals market, and higher sales volumes in general which increased overall factory utilization.  Offsetting these factors was the impact of lower sales of radios to natural gas utilities.  

	
	Selling, engineering and administration expenses in 2013 were $0.1 million, or 0.1% higher than these expenses in 2012.  The 2012 amounts included a $1.0 million charge related to the write down of the Companys investment in an emerging technology company.  The 2013 amounts include intangible amortization charges associated with the Aquacue acquisition, charges associated with a legal issue and normal inflationary increases.  Offsetting these increases were lower employee incentives and continuing cost control measures.

	Selling, engineering and administration expenses in 2012 increased $15.5 million, or 24.9%, over these expenses in 2011.  The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Racine Federated and amortization of intangibles acquired, which were not included in the results for 2011.  The remainder of the increase was due to higher employee incentives and normal inflationary increases, offset by continuing cost control measures.  The 2012 amounts include a $1.0 million charge related to the write down of the Companys investment in an emerging technology company and a $1.1 million non-cash pension charge as a result of payouts from the pension plan occurring faster than the assumed rate.


	Operating earnings in 2013 decreased $5.4 million, or 12.1%, to $39.1 million compared to $44.5 million in 2012.  The decrease was the result of the lower gross margins resulting from the mix of sales, the lower prices charged to customers of a former competitor, higher obsolescence costs and higher alloy costs, all offset somewhat by the higher net sales.

	Operating earnings in 2012 increased $17.0 million, or 61.8%, to $44.5 million compared to $27.5 million in 2011, as a net result of the higher sales of municipal water and industrial flow products, offset somewhat by higher selling, engineering and administration expenses.  In addition, lower costs of certain raw materials also contributed to the increased operating earnings.  

	
	Interest expense, net was $1.1 million in 2013 compared to $1.0 million in 2012.  The slight increase was due to higher average borrowings due in part to the Aquacue acquisition in April 2013.  

	Interest expense, net was $1.0 million in 2012 compared to $0.2 million in 2011.  The increase was due primarily to higher borrowings in 2012 associated with the acquisition of Racine Federated and the Companys stock repurchase program.



	Income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were 35.2%, 35.5% and 29.9% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The 2011 results include recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for certain deductions that were taken on prior tax returns.  These benefits total approximately $1.3 million and were recognized in earnings in 2011 due to the realization that such benefits became more likely than not upon the conclusion of an IRS audit of the Companys 2009 Federal income tax return.  Without these benefits, the provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for 2011 would have been 34.8%.  The variances in all three years presented are due to the changes in state taxes depending on each years sales and the relationship of foreign and domestic income which are taxed at different rates. 
	
	
	Because of the decreased operating earnings, net earnings were $24.6 million in 2013 compared to $28.0 million in 2012.  On a diluted basis, earnings per share were $1.70 in 2013 compared to $1.95 in 2012.

	As a result of the increased operating earnings, offset somewhat by a higher effective tax rate, net earnings were $28.0 million in 2012 compared to $19.2 million in 2011.  On a diluted basis, earnings per share were $1.95 in 2012 compared to $1.27 in 2011.

	
	The main sources of liquidity for the Company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity.  In addition, depending on market conditions, the Company may access the capital markets to strengthen its capital position and to provide additional liquidity for general corporate purposes.  Cash provided by operations in 2013 was $34.8 million compared to $34.8 million in 2012.  The 2013 amount had lower earnings, an increase in receivables and a decrease in certain liabilities from 2012, while the 2012 amounts contained an increase in inventories and a pension payment that did not recur in 2013.

	Receivables at December 31, 2013 were $50.1 million compared to $45.6 million at the end of 2012.  The increase was due in part to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.  The Company believes its net receivables balance is fully collectible.

	Inventories at December 31, 2013 were $60.9 million and substantially unchanged from $61.0 million at December 31, 2012.  

	Property, plant and equipment increased as a net result of capital expenditures offset by depreciation expense.  Capital expenditures totaled $14.3 million in 2013 compared to $8.2 million in 2012.  These amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures.  The Company believes it has adequate capacity to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures.

	Intangible assets decreased to $57.3 million at December 31, 2013 from $58.4 million at December 31, 2012.  This is the net impact of a $3.9 million increase due to the acquisition of Aquacue, more than offset by normal amortization expense.  Also, as a result of the Aquacue acquisition, goodwill increased to $44.7 million at December 31, 2013 compared to $35.9 million at December 31, 2012. 

	Due to higher than expected returns for the Companys pension assets, there was a prepaid pension amount of $4.3 million at December 31, 2013.  At December 31, 2012, a pension liability of $4.2 million was included in other accrued employee benefits, which saw a reduction to $4.4 million at December 31, 2013 from $8.9 million at December 31, 2012.    

	Short-term debt increased from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 as the Company borrowed funds for its acquisition of Aquacue.  At the end of 2013, debt represented 26.3% of the Companys total capitalization.  None of the debt is secured by the Companys assets.

	Payables increased at December 31, 2013 to $18.6 million compared to $15.6 million at December 31, 2012.  The 2012 amount included $4.6 million owed to the sellers of Racine Federated that was paid July 31, 2013.  The 2013 amount includes $3.0 million owed to the sellers of Aquacue that will be paid in 2014.  The remainder of the increase was due to the timing of purchases.  

	Accrued compensation and employee benefits decreased $2.5 million to $7.3 million at December 31, 2013 from $9.8 million at December 31, 2012 primarily due to lower accrued employee incentives.  </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">18


	The overall increase in total shareholders equity from $171.2 million at December 31, 2012 to $196.6 million at December 31, 2013 was principally the result of net earnings, stock options exercised and a reduction in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss as a result of favorable actuarial gains, net of their tax effect, offset by dividends paid.  

	The Companys financial condition remains strong.  In May 2012, the Company signed a new credit agreement that increased its principal line of credit from $90.0 million to $125.0 million with its primary lender for a three year period.  The line was reduced by $16.7 million in May 2013 and will be reduced by a similar amount in May 2014.  While the facility is unsecured, there are a number of financial covenants with which the Company is in compliance.  The Company believes that its operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity, and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures and the development of new products.  The Company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and carefully monitors the current borrowing market.  The Company had $47.8       million of unused credit lines available at December 31, 2013. 


	The Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2013.


	In 2010, the Company restructured the outstanding debt of its Employee Savings and Stock Option Plan (the ESSOP) by loaning the ESSOP $0.5 million to repay a loan to a third party and loaning the ESSOP an additional $1.0 million to purchase additional shares of the Company's Common Stock for future 401(k) savings plan matches under a program that will expire on December 31, 2020.  Under this program, the Company agreed to pay the principal and interest on the new loan amount of $1.5 million.  The receivable from the ESSOP and the related obligation were therefore netted to zero on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013 and 2012.  The terms of the loan call for equal payments of principal with the final payment due on December 31, 2020.  At December 31, 2013, $1.1 million of the loan balance remains.

	Other than items included in the preceding table, as of December 31, 2013, the Company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment, which generally have terms of less than 90 days.  The Company also has long-term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in Note 7 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of the most recent actuarial measurement date, the Company is not required to make a minimum contribution for its pension plan for the 2014 calendar year.  Postretirement medical claims are paid by the Company as they are submitted, and they are anticipated to be $0.5 million in 2014 based on actuarial estimates; however, these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the Company is self-insured.


	The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  The Company's more significant estimates relate primarily to the following judgmental reserves:  allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for obsolete inventories, warranty and after-sale costs reserve, and the healthcare reserve for claims incurred, but not reported.  Each of these reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the Company's Disclosure Committee and the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.  The basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">19


	The criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts vary by type of reserve.  For the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve, significant past due balances are individually reviewed for collectibility, while the balance of accounts are reviewed in conjunction with applying historical write-off ratios.  The calculation for the obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated usage to determine if excess quantities exist.  The calculation for warranty and after-sale costs reserve uses criteria that include known potential problems on past sales as well as historical claim experience and current warranty trends.  The healthcare reserve for claims incurred, but not reported is determined by using medical cost trend analyses, reviewing subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts.  The changes in the balances of these reserves at December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year were due to normal business conditions and are not deemed to be significant.   While the Company continually tries to improve its estimates, no significant changes in the underlying processes are expected in 2014.

	The Company also uses estimates in four other significant areas: (i) pension and other postretirement obligations and costs, (ii) stock-based compensation, (iii) income taxes, and (iv) evaluating goodwill at least annually for impairment.  The actuarial valuations of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs rely on key assumptions including discount rates and long-term expected returns on plan assets.  The Company's discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans are based on the average yield of a hypothetical high quality bond portfolio with maturities that approximately match the estimated cash flow needs of the plans.  The assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on assets for its pension plan are based on historical experience and estimated future investment returns, taking into consideration anticipated asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of various investment professionals.  The total cost of the Company's stock-based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted, adjusted for forfeitures.  Forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical Company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures, which could have an impact on the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period.  In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period.  On a quarterly basis, the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The reserve for uncertainty in income taxes is a matter of judgment based on an evaluation of the individual facts and circumstances of each tax position in light of all available evidence, including historic data and current trends.  A tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits of each tax position.  The Company evaluates and updates all of these assumptions quarterly.  Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value and is reviewed at least annually.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.

	
	The Company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations.  The Company is named as one of many potentially responsible parties in two landfill lawsuits.  The landfill sites are impacted by the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other environmental laws and regulations.  At this time, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations, either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole.  This belief is based on the Companys assessment of its limited past involvement with these landfill sites as well as the substantial involvement of and government focus on other named third parties with these landfill sites.  However, due to the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters.  A future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the Company, off-site disposal locations used by the Company, and property owned by third parties that is near such sites, could result in future costs to the Company and such amounts could be material.  Expenditures for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations during 2013, 2012 and 2011 were not material.

	Like other companies in recent years, the Company is named as a defendant in numerous pending multi-claimant/multi-defendant lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos, manufactured by third parties, and integrated into or sold with a very limited number of the Companys products.  The Company is vigorously defending itself against these claims.  Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations, either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole.  This belief is based in part on the fact </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">20


	See the Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements at the front of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's financial performance and results of operations.


	In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risks.  The Company operates in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense.  The Company believes it currently provides the leading technology in water meters and radio systems for water utilities.  A number of the Company's competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources.  Competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products, particularly those that provide radio solutions.  As the global water metering market begins to shift to adopt electronic (static) technology, the number of competitors may increase.  In addition, the market's level of acceptance of the Company's newer product offerings, including the recently introduced BEACON AMA system, may have a significant effect on the Company's results of operations.  As a result of significant research and development activities, the Company enjoys favorable patent positions for several of its products.

	The Company's ability to generate operating income and to increase profitability depends somewhat on the general health of the United States and foreign economies, including to some extent such things as the length and severity of global economic downturns; the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus fund programs, as well as the impact of government budget cuts or partial shutdowns of governmental operations; the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of the Company's products; the Company's ability to obtain financing; housing starts in the United States; and overall industrial activity.  In addition, changes in governmental laws and regulations, particularly laws dealing with the use of lead or rules affecting the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for radio products may impact the results of operations.  These factors are largely beyond the Company's control and depend on the economic condition and regulatory environment of the geographic region of the Company's operations.

	The Company relies on single suppliers for certain castings and components in several of its product lines.  Although alternate sources of supply exist for these items, the loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term.  The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers, purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate.

	Raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products include purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies and components.  The Company does not hold significant amounts of precious metals.  The price and availability of raw materials is influenced by economic and industry conditions, including supply and demand factors that are difficult to anticipate and cannot be controlled by the Company.  Commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the Company's forecasted usage.

	The Company's foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to foreign customers and purchases of material from foreign vendors.  The Company uses lines of credit with U.S. and European banks to offset currency exposure related to European receivables and other monetary assets.  As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company's foreign currency net monetary assets were partially offset by comparable debt resulting in no material exposure to the results of operations.  The Company believes the effect of a change in foreign currency rates will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations, either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole.

	The Company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading purposes.

	The Company's short-term debt on December 31, 2013 was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value.  Future annual interest costs for short-term debt will fluctuate based upon short-term interest rates.  For the short-term debt on hand on December 31, 2013, the effect of a 1% change in interest rates is approximately $0.7 million.

    Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting     
	

	</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 using the criteria set forth in </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Internal Control - Integrated Framework</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework).  Based on this assessment, the Company's management believes that, as of December 31, 2013, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
	
	</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Ernst &amp; Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.


                               BADGER METER, INC.                               

            Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm             



	We have audited Badger Meter, Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework)</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;"></font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">(the COSO criteria). Badger Meter, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	In our opinion, Badger Meter, Inc.</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;"></font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.  
	
	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Badger Meter, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 and our report dated February 20, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

            Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

(the Company) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Badger Meter, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Badger Meter, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February 20, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

                               BADGER METER, INC.                               
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements                   
                        December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011                         



	An innovator in flow measurement and control products, the Company serves water utilities, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers worldwide.  Measuring water, oil, chemicals and other fluids, the Companys products are known for accuracy, long-lasting durability and for providing valuable and timely measurement data.   The Companys product lines fall into </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">three</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">categories: sales of water meters and related technologies to municipal water utilities (municipal water), sales of meters to various industries for water and other fluids (industrial flow), and sales of gas meter radios and concrete vibrators to unique markets (specialty products).  The Company estimates that over </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">75%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of its products are used in water applications when all categories are grouped together.
	Municipal water, the largest category by sales volume, includes mechanical and electronic (static) water meters and related technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues.  The key market for the Companys water meter products is North America, primarily the United States, because most meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.  Sales of water meters and related technologies and services are commonly referred to as residential or commercial water meter sales, the latter referring to larger sizes of meters.  

	Industrial flow includes products sold worldwide to measure and control materials flowing through a pipe or pipeline including water, air, steam, oil, and other liquids and gases.  These meters and valves are used in a variety of applications, such as water/wastewater; heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC); oil and gas; chemical and petrochemical; food and beverage; and pharmaceutical production. 
	Specialty products include sales of radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters, and concrete vibrators.

	
	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 


	Receivables consist primarily of trade receivables.  The Company does not require collateral or other security and evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on a number of factors.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for significant past due receivable balances based on a review of the past due items and the customer's ability and likelihood to pay, as well as applying a historical write-off ratio to the remaining balances.

	(a)   The reserve increased </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$82,000</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in 2012 related to the acquisition of Racine Federated Inc.  Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions for a description of the acquisition.

	</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company has Common Stock and also Common Share Purchase Rights that trade with the Common Stock.  The Common Share Purchase Rights were issued pursuant to the shareholder rights plan discussed below.
	
	On February15, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">one</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Common Share Purchase Right for each outstanding share of Common Stock of the Company payable to the shareholders of record on May26, 2008.  The plan was effective as of May27, 2008.  Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">one</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">share of Common Stock at a price of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$200.00</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">per share, subject to adjustment.  Subject to certain conditions, the rights are redeemable by the Company and are exchangeable for shares of Common Stock at a favorable price.  The rights have no voting power and unless the rights are redeemed, exchanged or terminated earlier, they will expire on May26, 2018.  The rights are an embedded feature of the Companys Common Stock and not a free-standing instrument, and therefore, do not require separate accounting treatment.

	In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program up to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$30.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in shares of Common Stock in the open market for a period of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">two years</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">ending February10, 2014, if not terminated sooner.  At December31, 2012, </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">888,056</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">shares were repurchased aggregating </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$30.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, which completed this program.

	On April 1, 2013, the Company acquired </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">100.00%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of the outstanding common stock of Aquacue, Inc. (Aquacue) of Los Gatos, California.   The Aquacue acquisition provides the Company with intellectual property that complements and expands the Companys advanced metering analytics offerings by adding an integrated software platform that allows utility managers to monitor and control their water systems, while providing water management data to consumers.  Sales of Aquacue products were immaterial for 2013.  

	The purchase price was </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$13.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in cash, including a small working capital adjustment.  The purchase price included a final </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$3.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">payment, of which half was due January 10, 2014 and half is due October 10, 2014, and these amounts were recorded in payables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013.  The Companys allocation of the purchase price as of December 31, 2013 included </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$0.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of current assets, </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$1.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of deferred tax assets, </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$3.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of intangibles, </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$8.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of goodwill and </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$0.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of current liabilities.  As of December 31, 2013, the Company has completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The intangible assets acquired are primarily developed technology with an estimated average useful life of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">10 years</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  There was approximately </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$0.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of transaction costs related to the acquisition that were included in selling, engineering and administration for 2013 in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company merged Aquacue into Badger Meter, Inc. on December 31, 2013.

	The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations were included in the Companys financial statements from the date of acquisition.  The acquisition did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto.

	On January 31, 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">100%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of the outstanding common stock of Racine Federated, Inc. of Racine, Wisconsin and its subsidiary Premier Control Technologies, Ltd. (PCT) located in Thetford, England for approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$57.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in cash, plus a working capital adjustment of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The purchase price included a final </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$4.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">payment which was due on </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">July31, 2013</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and included in payables at December31, 2012.  Racine Federated manufactures and markets flow meters for the water industry as well as various industrial metering and specialty products.  These products complement and expand the Company's existing lines for the global flow measurement business.  
	
	The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of operations are included in the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition.  During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company sold PCT for a nominal amount after the majority of its functions were absorbed by the Company's European subsidiary.  The Company also merged Racine Federated into Badger Meter, Inc. on December31, 2012.

	The expected life is based on historical exercise behavior and the projected exercise of unexercised stock options.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option.  The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividends divided by the grant date market value of the Companys Common Stock.  The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys Common Stock.

	The Company makes commitments in the normal course of business.  At </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">December 31, 2013</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, the Company had various contractual obligations, specifically operating leases that totaled </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$12.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, of which </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.7 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">is due in </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2014</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and the remainder due between </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2015</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2025</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.


	In the normal course of business, the Company is named in legal proceedings.  There are currently no material legal proceedings pending with respect to the Company.  The more significant legal proceedings are discussed below.

	The Company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations.  The Company is named as </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">one</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of many potentially responsible parties in </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">two</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">landfill lawsuits.  The landfill sites are impacted by the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other environmental laws and regulations.  At this time, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations, either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole.  This belief is based on the Companys assessment of its limited past involvement with these landfill sites as well as the substantial involvement of and government focus on other named third parties with these landfill sites.  However, due to the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters.  A future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the Company, off-site disposal locations used by the Company, and property owned by third parties that is near such sites, could result in future costs to the Company and such amounts could be material.  Expenditures for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations during </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2013</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2012</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2011</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">were not material.
	
	Like other companies in recent years, the Company is named as a defendant in numerous pending multi-claimant/multi-defendant lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos, manufactured by third parties, and integrated into or sold with a very limited number of the Companys products.  The Company is vigorously defending itself against these claims.  Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations, either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole.  This belief is based in part on the fact that no claimant has proven or substantially demonstrated asbestos exposure caused by products manufactured or sold by the Company and that a number of cases have been voluntarily dismissed.

	The Company relies on single suppliers for most brass castings and certain electronic subassemblies in several of its product lines.  The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term.  The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers, purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate.  

	The Company reevaluates its exposures on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to reserves as appropriate.

	
	The Company maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers substantially all U.S. employees who were employed at December31, 2011.  After that date, no further benefits are being accrued in this plan.  The Company also maintains supplemental non-qualified pension plans for certain officers and other key employees, and an Employee Savings and Stock Option Plan (ESSOP).  For the frozen pension plan, benefits are based primarily on years of service and, for certain plans, levels of compensation.  

	The Company also has a postretirement healthcare benefit plan that provides medical benefits for certain U.S. retirees and eligible dependents hired prior to November 1, 2004.  Employees are eligible to receive postretirement healthcare benefits upon meeting certain age and service requirements.  No employees hired after October 31, 2004 are eligible to receive these benefits.  This plan requires employee contributions to offset benefit costs.

	The Company maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (sometimes referred to as the qualified pension plan) for certain employees.  On December31, 2010, the Company froze the qualified pension plan for its non-union participants and formed a new defined contribution feature within the ESSOP plan in which each employee received a similar benefit.  On December31, 2011, the Company froze the qualified pension plan for its union participants and included them in the same defined contribution feature within the ESSOP.  After December31, 2011, employees receive no future benefits under the qualified pension benefit plan as benefits were frozen and the employees now receive a defined contribution in its place.  Employees will continue to earn returns on their frozen balances.

	The Company's discount rate assumptions for the qualified pension plan are based on the average yield of a hypothetical high quality bond portfolio with maturities that approximately match the estimated cash flow needs of the plan.  The assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on assets are based on historical experience and estimated future investment returns, taking into consideration anticipated asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of various investment professionals.  The use of these assumptions can cause volatility if actual results differ from expected results.

The variation in the fair value of the assets between years was due to the change in the market value of the underlying investments and benefits paid.  Estimated future benefit payments expected to be paid in each of the next five years beginning with 2014 are </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$4.5 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$4.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$3.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$3.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$3.7 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, with an aggregate of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$15.9</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">million for the five years thereafter.

	The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.  Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of short- and long-term plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial condition.  The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments.  Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across various stocks, as well as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.  Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.  
	
	The expected role of plan equity investments is to maximize the long-term real growth of fund assets, while the role of fixed income investments is to generate current income, provide for more stable periodic returns and provide some protection against a prolonged decline in the market value of fund equity investments.  The current target allocations for plan assets are  </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">50%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">-</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">70%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">for equity securities, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">20%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">-</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">50%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">for fixed income securities, and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">0%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">-</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">15%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">for cash and alternative investments.  Equity securities include U.S. and international equities, while fixed income securities include long-duration and high-yield bond funds.

	The discount rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">4.73%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">for </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2013</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">3.92%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">for </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2012</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The Company's discount rate assumptions for its postretirement benefit plan are based on the average yield of a hypothetical high quality bond portfolio with maturities that approximately match the estimated cash flow needs of the plan.  Because the plan requires the Company to establish fixed Company contribution amounts for retiree healthcare benefits, future healthcare cost trends do not generally impact the Company's accruals or provisions.

	In 2010, the Company restructured the outstanding debt of its ESSOP by loaning the ESSOP </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.5 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">to repay a loan to a third party and loaning the ESSOP an additional </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">to purchase additional shares of the Companys Common Stock for future 401(k) savings plan matches under a program that will expire on </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">December31, 2020</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.

Unreleased shares are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share.
	
	The ESSOP includes a voluntary 401(k) savings plan that allows certain employees to defer up to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">20%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of their income on a pretax basis subject to limits on maximum amounts.  The Company matches </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">25%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of each employees contribution, with the match percentage applying to a maximum of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">7%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of each employee's salary.  The match is paid using the Company's Common Stock released through the ESSOP loan payments.  For ESSOP shares purchased prior to 1993, compensation expense is recognized based on the original purchase price of the shares released and dividends on unreleased shares are charged to compensation expense.  For shares purchased in or after 1993, expense is based on the market value of the shares on the date released and dividends on unreleased shares are charged to compensation expense.  Compensation expense of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">was recognized for the match for each of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2013</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2012</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2011</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.
	
	On December31, 2010, the Company froze the qualified pension plan for its non-union participants and formed a new defined contribution feature within the ESSOP plan in which each employee received a similar benefit.  On December31, 2011, the Company froze the qualified pension plan for its union participants and included them in the same defined contribution feature within the ESSOP.  For </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2013</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, compensation expense under the defined contribution feature totaled </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$2.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.

	The Company does not expect a significant increase or decrease to the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal year ending </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">December31, 2014</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  To the extent these unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized, they will impact the effective tax rate in a future period, possibly as early as the fiscal year ending </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">December31, 2014</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.
	
	The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2009.  The Company's policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expenses.  Accrued interest was approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">at both </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">December31, 2013</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and 2012, and there were no penalties accrued in either year.

	The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter.
