00011. The aggregate market value of the Common Stock held by non-affiliates of the Company as of June 28, 2013 was $613,399,995.  For purposes of this calculation only, (i) shares of Common Stock are deemed to have a market value of $44.55 per share, the closing price of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on June 28, 2013, and (ii) each of the Company's executive officers and directors is deemed to be an affiliate of the Company.
00012. As of February 6, 2014, there were 14,406,540 shares of Common Stock outstanding with a par value of $1 per share.
00053. The graph assumes $100 invested on December 31, 2008.  It further assumes the reinvestment of dividends.  The returns of each component company in the peer groups have been weighted based on such company's relative market capitalization.
00065. Net sales in 2013 increased $14.4 million, or 4.5%, to $334.1 million from $319.7 million in 2012.  The overall increase was due primarily to higher sales of municipal water products as a result of higher volumes of units sold, offset somewhat by lower sales of industrial and specialty products.
00066. Municipal water sales increased $17.9 million, or 8.4%, to $231.1 million in 2013 from $213.2 million in 2012.  These sales represented 69.2% of total net sales in 2013 compared to 66.7% in 2012.  The sales increase was due to higher sales of residential meters sold both with and without technology as well as higher commercial meter sales.  Sales of residential meters and related technology increased 6.9% for the year due to higher volumes of product sold, slightly offset by lower average prices.  Commercial water meter sales increased 15.2% in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to higher volumes of product sold.  The Company believes the net overall increase for the year was a continuation of a return to normal buying patterns that began in 2012, although sales were negatively affected in early 2013 by a colder and snowier winter and the effects of Hurricane Sandy.  In addition, part of the increase was due to additional sales to former customers of a competitor that ceased North American production of mechanical meters on June 30, 2013.  The Company estimates sales to these customers were approximately $4.1 million in 2013.   
00067. Industrial flow products represented 27.3% of total net sales in 2013 compared to 29.0% in 2012.  These sales decreased $1.6 million, or 1.7%, to $91.2 million from $92.8 million in 2012.  Sales of products within this category were affected by general economic conditions which resulted in weaker orders.  
00068. Specialty products represented 3.5% of total net sales in 2013 compared to 4.3% in 2012.  These sales decreased $1.9 million in 2013, or 13.9%, to $11.8 million from $13.7 million in 2012.  The decline was caused by lower sales of radios into the natural gas market and lower sales of concrete vibrators.
00069. International sales for municipal water meters and related technologies are generally made to customers in Canada and Mexico, which use similar mechanical technology and standards as customers in the U.S.  International sales for industrial flow and specialty products are generally made throughout the world.  In Europe, sales are made primarily in Euros.  Other international sales are made in U.S. dollars or local currencies.  International sales decreased 9.3% to $44.1 million in 2013 from $48.6 million in 2012 primarily due to the timing of large projects and general economic conditions.  
00070. Net sales in 2012 increased $56.8 million, or 21.6%, to $319.7 million from $262.9 million in 2011.  The overall increase was due to the inclusion of Racine Federateds net sales for eleven months of the year and higher municipal water sales, offset somewhat by lower sales of radios to natural gas utilities.  Racine Federateds sales for the eleven months ended December 31, 2012 were $41.3 million. 
00071. Municipal water sales increased $22.9 million, or 12.0%, to $213.2 million in 2012 from $190.3 million in 2011.  These sales represented 66.7% of total net sales in 2012 compared to 72.4% in 2011.  The sales increase was due to higher sales of residential meters sold with technology as well as higher commercial meter sales.  Sales of meters with technology increased 11.6% for the year due to higher volumes of product sold.  Sales of manually read residential meters were essentially flat between years.  Commercial water meter sales increased 19.5% in 2012 compared to 2011 due to higher volumes of product sold.  The Company believes the net overall increase for the year was due to normal buying patterns beginning to resume after a period where there were negative factors affecting market conditions.  These factors included lingering concerns about municipal spending, which resulted in delayed buying decisions, and slower housing starts.  In addition, the Companys introduction in 2011 of the next generation of the ORION product lengthened the sales cycle for water utilities as they evaluated this new technology.  Weather may have also played a role as poor weather in the Midwest and Northeast had a negative impact on sales in early 2011 due to its effects on budget demands and installation rates, which did not recur in early 2012.
00072. Industrial flow products represented 29.0% of total net sales in 2012 compared to 21.5% in 2011.  These sales increased $36.2 million, or 64.0%, to $92.8 million from $56.6 million in 2011.  As previously noted, Racine Federated was acquired on January 31, 2012 and Racine Federateds sales were included from that point forward.  Within this product grouping, Racine Federateds sales were $32.6 million.  The remainder of the increase was due to higher sales in most of the remaining industrial flow product lines. 
00073. Specialty products represented 4.3% of total net sales in 2012 compared to 6.1% in 2011.  These sales decreased $2.3 </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">16
00074. International sales for municipal water meters and related technologies are generally made to customers in Canada and Mexico, which use similar mechanical technology and standards as customers in the U.S.  International sales for industrial flow and specialty products are generally made throughout the world.  In Europe, sales are made primarily in Euros.  Other international sales are made in U.S. dollars or local currencies.  International sales increased 53.8% to $48.6 million in 2012 from $31.6 million in 2011 primarily due to the addition of Racine Federateds product lines.  
00079. Selling, engineering and administration expenses in 2013 were $0.1 million, or 0.1% higher than these expenses in 2012.  The 2012 amounts included a $1.0 million charge related to the write down of the Companys investment in an emerging technology company.  The 2013 amounts include intangible amortization charges associated with the Aquacue acquisition, charges associated with a legal issue and normal inflationary increases.  Offsetting these increases were lower employee incentives and continuing cost control measures.
00080. Selling, engineering and administration expenses in 2012 increased $15.5 million, or 24.9%, over these expenses in 2011.  The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Racine Federated and amortization of intangibles acquired, which were not included in the results for 2011.  The remainder of the increase was due to higher employee incentives and normal inflationary increases, offset by continuing cost control measures.  The 2012 amounts include a $1.0 million charge related to the write down of the Companys investment in an emerging technology company and a $1.1 million non-cash pension charge as a result of payouts from the pension plan occurring faster than the assumed rate.
00081. Operating earnings in 2013 decreased $5.4 million, or 12.1%, to $39.1 million compared to $44.5 million in 2012.  The decrease was the result of the lower gross margins resulting from the mix of sales, the lower prices charged to customers of a former competitor, higher obsolescence costs and higher alloy costs, all offset somewhat by the higher net sales.
00082. Operating earnings in 2012 increased $17.0 million, or 61.8%, to $44.5 million compared to $27.5 million in 2011, as a net result of the higher sales of municipal water and industrial flow products, offset somewhat by higher selling, engineering and administration expenses.  In addition, lower costs of certain raw materials also contributed to the increased operating earnings.  
00084. Interest expense, net was $1.1 million in 2013 compared to $1.0 million in 2012.  The slight increase was due to higher average borrowings due in part to the Aquacue acquisition in April 2013.  
00085. Interest expense, net was $1.0 million in 2012 compared to $0.2 million in 2011.  The increase was due primarily to higher borrowings in 2012 associated with the acquisition of Racine Federated and the Companys stock repurchase program.
00086. Income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes were 35.2%, 35.5% and 29.9% for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The 2011 results include recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for certain deductions that were taken on prior tax returns.  These benefits total approximately $1.3 million and were recognized in earnings in 2011 due to the realization that such benefits became more likely than not upon the conclusion of an IRS audit of the Companys 2009 Federal income tax return.  Without these benefits, the provision for income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for 2011 would have been 34.8%.  The variances in all three years presented are due to the changes in state taxes depending on each years sales and the relationship of foreign and domestic income which are taxed at different rates. 
00089. Because of the decreased operating earnings, net earnings were $24.6 million in 2013 compared to $28.0 million in 2012.  On a diluted basis, earnings per share were $1.70 in 2013 compared to $1.95 in 2012.
00090. As a result of the increased operating earnings, offset somewhat by a higher effective tax rate, net earnings were $28.0 million in 2012 compared to $19.2 million in 2011.  On a diluted basis, earnings per share were $1.95 in 2012 compared to $1.27 in 2011.
00092. The main sources of liquidity for the Company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity.  In addition, depending on market conditions, the Company may access the capital markets to strengthen its capital position and to provide additional liquidity for general corporate purposes.  Cash provided by operations in 2013 was $34.8 million compared to $34.8 million in 2012.  The 2013 amount had lower earnings, an increase in receivables and a decrease in certain liabilities from 2012, while the 2012 amounts contained an increase in inventories and a pension payment that did not recur in 2013.
00093. Receivables at December 31, 2013 were $50.1 million compared to $45.6 million at the end of 2012.  The increase was due in part to higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.  The Company believes its net receivables balance is fully collectible.
00094. Inventories at December 31, 2013 were $60.9 million and substantially unchanged from $61.0 million at December 31, 2012.  
00095. Property, plant and equipment increased as a net result of capital expenditures offset by depreciation expense.  Capital expenditures totaled $14.3 million in 2013 compared to $8.2 million in 2012.  These amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures.  The Company believes it has adequate capacity to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures.
00096. Intangible assets decreased to $57.3 million at December 31, 2013 from $58.4 million at December 31, 2012.  This is the net impact of a $3.9 million increase due to the acquisition of Aquacue, more than offset by normal amortization expense.  Also, as a result of the Aquacue acquisition, goodwill increased to $44.7 million at December 31, 2013 compared to $35.9 million at December 31, 2012. 
00097. Due to higher than expected returns for the Companys pension assets, there was a prepaid pension amount of $4.3 million at December 31, 2013.  At December 31, 2012, a pension liability of $4.2 million was included in other accrued employee benefits, which saw a reduction to $4.4 million at December 31, 2013 from $8.9 million at December 31, 2012.    
00099. Payables increased at December 31, 2013 to $18.6 million compared to $15.6 million at December 31, 2012.  The 2012 amount included $4.6 million owed to the sellers of Racine Federated that was paid July 31, 2013.  The 2013 amount includes $3.0 million owed to the sellers of Aquacue that will be paid in 2014.  The remainder of the increase was due to the timing of purchases.  
00100. Accrued compensation and employee benefits decreased $2.5 million to $7.3 million at December 31, 2013 from $9.8 million at December 31, 2012 primarily due to lower accrued employee incentives.  </font><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">18
00101. The overall increase in total shareholders equity from $171.2 million at December 31, 2012 to $196.6 million at December 31, 2013 was principally the result of net earnings, stock options exercised and a reduction in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss as a result of favorable actuarial gains, net of their tax effect, offset by dividends paid.  
00102. The Companys financial condition remains strong.  In May 2012, the Company signed a new credit agreement that increased its principal line of credit from $90.0 million to $125.0 million with its primary lender for a three year period.  The line was reduced by $16.7 million in May 2013 and will be reduced by a similar amount in May 2014.  While the facility is unsecured, there are a number of financial covenants with which the Company is in compliance.  The Company believes that its operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity, and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures and the development of new products.  The Company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and carefully monitors the current borrowing market.  The Company had $47.8       million of unused credit lines available at December 31, 2013. 
00104. In 2010, the Company restructured the outstanding debt of its Employee Savings and Stock Option Plan (the ESSOP) by loaning the ESSOP $0.5 million to repay a loan to a third party and loaning the ESSOP an additional $1.0 million to purchase additional shares of the Company's Common Stock for future 401(k) savings plan matches under a program that will expire on December 31, 2020.  Under this program, the Company agreed to pay the principal and interest on the new loan amount of $1.5 million.  The receivable from the ESSOP and the related obligation were therefore netted to zero on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013 and 2012.  The terms of the loan call for equal payments of principal with the final payment due on December 31, 2020.  At December 31, 2013, $1.1 million of the loan balance remains.  
00109. Other than items included in the preceding table, as of December 31, 2013, the Company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment, which generally have terms of less than 90 days.  The Company also has long-term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in Note 7 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of the most recent actuarial measurement date, the Company is not required to make a minimum contribution for its pension plan for the 2014 calendar year.  Postretirement medical claims are paid by the Company as they are submitted, and they are anticipated to be $0.5 million in 2014 based on actuarial estimates; however, these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the Company is self-insured.
00123. The Company's short-term debt on December 31, 2013 was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value.  Future annual interest costs for short-term debt will fluctuate based upon short-term interest rates.  For the short-term debt on hand on December 31, 2013, the effect of a 1% change in interest rates is approximately $0.7 million.
00149. Each common share of stock equals </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">par value; therefore, the number of common shares is the same as the dollar value.
00158. (a)   The reserve increased </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$82,000</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in 2012 related to the acquisition of Racine Federated Inc.  Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions for a description of the acquisition.
00159. (b)  The reserve increased </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$40,000</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in 2011 related to the acquisition of Remag AG.  Refer to Note 3 Acquisitions for a description of the acquisition.
00162. On February15, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">one</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Common Share Purchase Right for each outstanding share of Common Stock of the Company payable to the shareholders of record on May26, 2008.  The plan was effective as of May27, 2008.  Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">one</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">share of Common Stock at a price of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$200.00</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">per share, subject to adjustment.  Subject to certain conditions, the rights are redeemable by the Company and are exchangeable for shares of Common Stock at a favorable price.  The rights have no voting power and unless the rights are redeemed, exchanged or terminated earlier, they will expire on May26, 2018.  The rights are an embedded feature of the Companys Common Stock and not a free-standing instrument, and therefore, do not require separate accounting treatment.
00163. In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program up to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$30.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in shares of Common Stock in the open market for a period of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">two years</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">ending February10, 2014, if not terminated sooner.  At December31, 2012, </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">888,056</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">shares were repurchased aggregating </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$30.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, which completed this program.
00167. The purchase price was </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$13.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in cash, including a small working capital adjustment.  The purchase price included a final </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$3.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">payment, of which half was due January 10, 2014 and half is due October 10, 2014, and these amounts were recorded in payables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2013.  The Companys allocation of the purchase price as of December 31, 2013 included </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$0.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of current assets, </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$1.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of deferred tax assets, </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$3.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of intangibles, </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$8.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of goodwill and </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$0.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of current liabilities.  As of December 31, 2013, the Company has completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The intangible assets acquired are primarily developed technology with an estimated average useful life of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">10 years</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  There was approximately </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;">$0.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of transaction costs related to the acquisition that were included in selling, engineering and administration for 2013 in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company merged Aquacue into Badger Meter, Inc. on December 31, 2013.
00169. On January 31, 2012, the Company completed its acquisition of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">100%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of the outstanding common stock of Racine Federated, Inc. of Racine, Wisconsin and its subsidiary Premier Control Technologies, Ltd. (PCT) located in Thetford, England for approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$57.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">in cash, plus a working capital adjustment of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  The purchase price included a final </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$4.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">payment which was due on </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">July31, 2013</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">and included in payables at December31, 2012.  Racine Federated manufactures and markets flow meters for the water industry as well as various industrial metering and specialty products.  These products complement and expand the Company's existing lines for the global flow measurement business.  
00181. On </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">January 26, 2011</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, the Company purchased Remag AG of Bern, Switzerland for </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$4.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.  Remag manufactures and markets a small plastic turbine meter used in HVAC and white goods.  The Company included these products with its other industrial flow products.  The Companys purchase price allocation included </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of cash, plus approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of receivables, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of inventory, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of other assets, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$2.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of fixed assets, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of intangibles, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of goodwill and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">of liabilities.
